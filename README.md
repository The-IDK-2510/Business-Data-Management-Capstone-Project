# Business-Data-Management-Capstone-Project

## Data-Driven Optimization of Inventory and Client Profitability

### Project Overview
This project analyzes two key business problems for a medical product distribution firm:
1. Ineffective inventory management due to intermittent demand
2. Lack of visibility into client-level profitability

The project was completed as an academic capstone and applies real-world business analytics techniques.

### Business Problems
- Inventory decisions were based on intuition, leading to overstocking and stockouts.
- Client relationships were not evaluated thus leading to lack of visibility on financial sustainability.

### Data & Tools
- Data Time period: January 2025 – June 2025
- Tools: Microsoft Excel, Python
- Techniques: Croston’s Method, ABC/XYZ Analysis, Pareto Analysis

### Key Insights
- A small subset of products (AX, AY, AZ categories) accounts for the majority of forecasted demand and expected profits, while most products exhibit low-volume, intermittent demand.
- Inventory risk is primarily driven by demand variability and lead-time uncertainty, making intuition-based restocking inefficient and capital-intensive.
- Client profitability is highly concentrated: a small group of clients generates the majority of profits and revenue, while many clients contribute minimally despite their volume.
- High revenue does not necessarily imply high profitability; several clients generate sales with weak margins, reducing overall efficiency.

### Recommendations
- Prioritize inventory investment and buffer stock for AX, AY, and AZ products to reduce stockouts and protect revenue-critical items.
- Reduce capital allocation to low-demand, unstable categories and improve future forecasting accuracy by tracking procurement lead times.
- Focus relationship management and retention efforts on high-profit clients (AA, AB, AC), as they form the core profit base.
- Reassess low-profit client segments (CA, CB, CC) through pricing review or reduced resource allocation to prevent value erosion.
